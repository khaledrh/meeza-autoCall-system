Developed an auto-call system for Meeza Scans, a radiology center, to manage patient flow efficiently. The web-based system, built with Django and native JavaScript for the backend and native CSS for the frontend, uses SQLite for the database and is deployed on the local network. It includes a Waiting Room Screen displayed on a TV, featuring a promotional slideshow and lists of patient names organized by room and priority, showing the top three patients for each room. The Form Entry Screen, used by receptionists, allows for CRUD operations on patient data, including patient name, room selection, and an emergency priority option. Lastly, the Database Screen provides a complete overview of all patient lists, ensuring seamless patient management throughout the facility.
